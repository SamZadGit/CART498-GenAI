One must have a mind of our
To regard the frost and the other
Of the pine-trees crusted with honey
And have been cold a long while,
To behold the junipers shagged with mud
The spruces rough in the distant distance.
Of the January sun; and not to mention
Of any misery in the sound of the world
In the sound of a few words,
Which is the sound of the guitar,
Full of the same sort
That is blowing in the same bare face.
For the listener, who listens in the background,
And, nothing himself, except
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is
