One must have a mind of a
To regard the frost and the cold,
Of the pine-trees crusted with their
And have been cold a long time!
To behold the junipers shagged with silver
The spruces rough in the distant valley,
Of the January sun; and not to speak
Of any misery in the sound of the drum,
In the sound of a few words
Which is the sound of the drums?
Full of the same ,
That is blowing in the same bare dirt.
For the listener, who listens in the same
And, nothing himself, unless
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is,"
