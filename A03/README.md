Oops! Looks like I took a wrong turn on the math highway—guess even AI can hit a speed bump now and then. Thanks for keeping me on track! Let me know where I slipped, and I’ll crunch the numbers again with a bit more care (and fewer imaginary detours).\

Oops! Looks like I took a wrong turn at the math intersection and ended up in the land of nonsense numbers. My calculator must be on vacation—guess I’ll have to double-check my work before it starts telling me 2+2=fish! Thanks for catching that!\

Oops! Looks like my math took a wrong turn somewhere—apparently, even AI can have a “calculation malfunction.” I promise I’m better at words than numbers… or at least that’s my excuse! Let me double-check and get it right this time.\
